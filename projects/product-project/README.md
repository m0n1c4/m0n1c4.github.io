Product Project
===

Given the data at `data/products.json`, create a searchable list of products.

Note: 

* We've included a few utilities for you to use, but you'll definitely want to use jQuery, and maybe a CSS library, too.
* Feel free to use bower or a similar client-side package manager for your project.
* There are also product thumbnails and detailed images within the `img/product` directory!
